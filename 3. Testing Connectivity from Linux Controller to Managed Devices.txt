TESTING CONNECTIVITY FROM LINUX CONTROLLER TO MANAGED DEVICES:


1. TESTING CONNECTIVITY WITH PING UTILITY:

	#ping IP_of_Managed_Device

	#ping r1						(If not working then setup up DNS server or edit /etc/hosts file.)




2. EDITING /etc/hosts FILE IN LINUX FOR NAME RESOLUTION:

	#vim /etc/hosts

	127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
	::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

	192.168.2.201   r1.trainonic.com        r1		(This line is added in the file.)

		- Repeat the same steps for other Routers.

		- Save and quit the file.

	#ping r1						(Now, it should work.)




3. SSH FROM THE LINUX CONTROLLER TO THE MANAGED DEVICES:

	#ssh admin@r1						("admin" is the username created in Managed Devices.)

								- "r1" is the device name which resolves to "192.168.2.201" IP address.

	NOTE:

	- If you get an error as shown below, then follow the steps mentioned on Forth point "4.".

	ERROR:
	"Unable to negotiate with 192.168.2.201 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group
	 exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1"




4. SET THE "CRYPTO-POLICIES" TO LEGACY IN LINUX MACHINE:

	- This setup is only done, when you get the error, mentioned on point "3.".

	- This is because, you're using the legacy managed cisco devices.

	- Thus, you need to set the crypto-policies to legacy so that it matches with the legacy crypto-policies that are in the Cisco 
	  Managed Devices.

#update-crypto-policies --show					(To view the current set crypto-policies in Linux machine.)

								- By default, the crypto-policies are set to DEFAULT.

								- So, you need to change it to LEGACY.


#update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY				(Setting up crypto-policies to LEGACY.)


#update-crypto-policies --show					(Verifying the crypto-policies.)

								- & it should show you, that it is set to "LEGACY".


#reboot								(Reboot the system to take the changes into effect.)




5. SSH TO THE MANAGED DEVICE FROM LINUX CONTROLLER:

#ssh admin@r1

yes								(To save the finger print.)

password							(Login password of the admin user which was created on Managed Devices.)




6. VERIFYING THE SAVED FINGERPRINT:
#cat /home/trainonic/.ssh/known_hosts

r1 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCqzxXXuoU2V81DKLcjwUFkd/m/uRpoKk+ZSJaKVGQoTiDG7gGZk7sWWJrrAEXBLli8gW+nRrwFVB68+eoA6Ow/XL5jfVtUyf42O6TRmj9ZuPwBLZcJiqYrA+VgnHTNXcORm2nXfCUa/5BO3ie10Qq/6QBwCl0wlh9CwE/zfV5qPh10mEU8f3KEj/GDRE/3db7Z7P4DaPb67akrdM+v0kYDZaUlnOacjSV+XT63pSp1aCGIxtyyCpo6KG6/nlpFXEGIPfCzzxoaPxK7Gv9dQs/pIcyaFtNRzqM3ZrCfJ8HFPHiK1ku+fQSiXNoMvbSiIrZO4s+bWeYISQEwE1LI1xuP
